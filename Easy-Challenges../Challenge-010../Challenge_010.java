 * Challenge 010 : The exercise today asks you to validate a telephone number,
 * as if written on an input form. Telephone numbers can be written as ten
 * digits, or with dashes, spaces, or dots between the three segments, or with
 * the area code parenthesized; both the area code and any white space between
 * segments are optional. Thus, all of the following are valid telephone
 * numbers: 1234567890, 123-456-7890, 123.456.7890, (123)456-7890, (123)
 * 456-7890 (note the white space following the area code), and 456-7890.
 * 
 * The following are not valid telephone numbers: 123-45-6789, 123:4567890, and
 * 123/456-7890.
